`react-native-watch-connectivity` is a library for interacting with Apple Watch apps from a companion React Native app.

**Note:** this library does NOT allow you to create a Watch App in react native but rather facilitates communication with a Watch App written in Swift/Objective-C.

Features:
- Communication including both interactive messaging & background transfers
- File transfers
- Watch monitoring including reachability, pairing status & watch app installation.
